The game features an original story inspired by the comic book lore rather than following the plot of the film of the same name. Players take on the role of Peter Parker as Spider-Man, swinging through a detailed recreation of Manhattan while battling classic villains from Spider-Man's rogues gallery. The game introduces a new \"Hero or Menace\" system where players must balance stopping crime with maintaining their reputation. With improved web-swinging mechanics, enhanced combat, and a larger open world than its predecessor, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 delivers an authentic superhero experience with plenty of side activities and collectibles to discover.",

The game is set in Egypt during the Ptolemaic period (49-43 BCE) and recounts the secret fictional history of real-world events. The story explores the origins of the centuries-long conflict between the Brotherhood of Assassins, who fight for peace by promoting liberty, and The Order of the Ancients—forerunners to the Templar Order—who desire peace through the forced imposition of order. Players control Bayek, a Medjay, as he works to protect the people of Egypt and eventually becomes the first Assassin. The game features a massive open world, naval combat, and a revamped combat system that emphasizes hitbox-based mechanics and RPG elements.",

It is the fifth main installment in the Call of Duty series and returns the franchise to World War II, focusing on the Pacific and Eastern Fronts. The game features a more gritty and realistic depiction of WWII combat than previous Call of Duty titles, with intense violence and gore. Players experience the war through the perspectives of US Marine Raider Private C. Miller and Soviet Red Army soldier Private Dimitri Petrenko across various iconic battles. World at War introduced the fan-favorite Nazi Zombies mode, which became a staple of the franchise. The game also features a robust multiplayer component with deep progression systems and classic Call of Duty gameplay that set the foundation for future titles.",

It was released in 2016 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and later for Microsoft Windows. The game is set in the Stone Age, around 10,000 BCE, and follows a hunter named Takkar as he attempts to survive in the fictional valley of Oros. Unlike previous Far Cry games, Primal does not feature firearms or explosives, instead focusing on primitive weapons like bows, clubs, spears, and slings. The game introduces a beast mastery system that allows players to tame and command various animals to assist them in combat and hunting. The game's open world is filled with dangerous predators, hostile tribes, and environmental hazards. Players must hunt for food, craft weapons and tools, and build their tribe to survive in this brutal prehistoric setting.",

The game features the same open-world gameplay as Far Cry 3 but with neon-soaked visuals, VHS-style effects, and a synthwave soundtrack. You'll battle against cyber soldiers, mutants, and of course, blood dragons - genetically engineered killing machines that can be turned against your enemies. With its over-the-top action, hilarious dialogue, and loving parody of 80s action movies, Blood Dragon offers a unique experience that stands apart from the main Far Cry series while delivering the same satisfying gameplay.",

It is the third main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series and the first to feature a 3D open world. Set within the fictional Liberty City (based on New York City), the game follows a silent protagonist named Claude as he navigates the criminal underworld after being betrayed and left for dead. The game revolutionized open-world design with its \"living city\" approach, giving players unprecedented freedom to explore the city, complete missions, or simply cause chaos. Its non-linear gameplay and mature themes made it both controversial and wildly successful, selling over 14.5 million copies and becoming one of the most influential video games of all time. Grand Theft Auto III introduced many mechanics that became series staples, including the wanted level system, radio stations with diverse music and talk shows, and a mission structure that gradually unlocks new areas of the city as the story progresses.",

        "aboutGame": "Manhunt 2 is a psychological horror stealth game developed by Rockstar Games. The game follows the story of Daniel Lamb, a former scientist who wakes up in a mental institution with no memory of his past. As he pieces together his identity, he must escape the facility and uncover the truth behind his condition while being pursued by a mysterious organization. The game is notorious for its brutal and graphic violence, which led to it being banned in several countries. Players must use stealth to sneak up on enemies and execute them in increasingly violent ways, with the game's unique \"execution\" system rewarding more points for more elaborate kills. With its dark atmosphere, disturbing themes, and intense gameplay, Manhunt 2 pushes boundaries and delivers an experience unlike any other game. The PC version includes restored content that was censored in other releases, making it the definitive version of this controversial classic.",

It is the perfect way to experience the terrifying world of Metro for the first time, or to return to the post-apocalyptic tunnels of Moscow in the definitive version of one of the finest story-driven shooters of all time. In 2013 the world was devastated by an apocalyptic event, annihilating almost all mankind and turning the Earth's surface into a poisonous wasteland. A handful of survivors took refuge in the depths of the Moscow underground, and human civilization entered a new Dark Age. The year is 2033. An entire generation has been born and raised underground, and their besieged Metro Station-Cities struggle for survival, with each other, and the mutant horrors that await outside. You are Artyom, born in the last days before the fire, but raised Underground. Having never ventured beyond your Metro Station-City limits, one fateful event sparks a desperate mission to the heart of the Metro system, to warn the remnants of mankind of a terrible impending threat. Your journey takes you from the forgotten catacombs beneath the subway to the desolate wastelands above, where your actions will determine the fate of mankind.",

The couple are investigating the murder of a pregnant woman when their helicopter crashes in the desert, leaving them stranded in a village inhabited by a deranged cult.

The game features non-linear level design, allowing players to explore the Island of Time in different orders, and introduces new time-based powers that expand the Prince's abilities. With its atmospheric environments, challenging platforming, and intense combat, Warrior Within remains a standout title in the action-adventure genre.",

You play as David Jones, an ex-SAS operative working as a freelance spy for the British Institute for Geotactical Intelligence (IGI). The game was groundbreaking for its time, featuring large open levels that allowed for multiple approaches to objectives, realistic weapon behavior, and an emphasis on stealth and tactics rather than run-and-gun gameplay. With its challenging AI, realistic environments, and strategic gameplay, Project IGI remains a cult classic among tactical shooter fans. The game features 15 missions across diverse locations including military bases, snowy mountain facilities, and secret underground bunkers.",

Originally released in 1996 for the PlayStation, it is the first game in the Resident Evil series and established many of the conventions seen in later games. The game follows Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine, members of an elite task force known as S.T.A.R.S., as they investigate the outskirts of Raccoon City following the disappearance of their team members. They soon become trapped in a mansion infested with zombies and other monsters. Featuring tense gameplay, limited resources, puzzle-solving elements, and a chilling atmosphere, Resident Evil revolutionized the horror genre in video games. The PC version includes enhanced graphics and additional content not found in the original release.",

Set in a reimagined late 1500s Sengoku period Japan, you play as the 'one-armed wolf', a disgraced and disfigured warrior rescued from the brink of death. Bound to protect a young lord of mysterious lineage, you become the target of many vicious enemies. When the young lord is captured, nothing will stop you on a perilous quest to regain your honor—not even death itself. The game features intense sword combat, a variety of prosthetic tools, vertical exploration, and the ability to resurrect after death. With its punishing difficulty, precise combat system, and rich world-building, Sekiro offers a uniquely satisfying experience for players who enjoy challenging games.",

You and up to 3 friends find yourselves trapped in the Backrooms - an endless maze of randomly generated office spaces, dark hallways, and eerie environments. Work together to solve puzzles, avoid terrifying entities, and find your way out before you lose your sanity. The game features multiple levels with distinct challenges, each more horrifying than the last. With both single-player and online cooperative modes, you can choose to face the horrors alone or with friends. The procedurally generated levels ensure no two playthroughs are exactly the same, keeping the experience fresh and unpredictable. Will you escape the Backrooms, or become another lost soul wandering its infinite corridors?",

You play as a hitchhiker stranded in the remote Norwood region, forced to accept a ride from a mysterious stranger. The game masterfully builds tension through atmospheric sound design, limited visibility, and psychological horror elements. Unlike traditional horror games, there are no weapons - only your wits and ability to make quick decisions under pressure. The VHS-style visuals and found footage aesthetic heighten the realism, making every encounter feel terrifyingly plausible. With multiple endings based on your choices, each playthrough offers new scares and revelations. Inspired by actual events, this episode will make you question whether to ever accept help from strangers again.",

  "aboutGame": "POOLS is a unique psychological horror game that immerses players in a series of surreal swimming pool environments. With no traditional monsters or jump scares, the game creates tension through atmospheric sound design, unsettling environments, and psychological discomfort. Players navigate through increasingly bizarre pool areas, solving subtle puzzles and experiencing the game's distinctive brand of horror. The game features six chapters, each lasting about 10-30 minutes, with a strong focus on environmental storytelling and player immersion. POOLS stands out for its minimalist approach to horror, relying on players' imaginations and the uncanny atmosphere to create fear rather than explicit threats.",

  "aboutGame": "Alien: Isolation is a first-person survival horror game that captures the essence of Ridley Scott's 1979 sci-fi horror masterpiece. Set 15 years after the original Alien film, you play as Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley, investigating the disappearance of her mother. Trapped aboard the derelict Sevastopol space station with a single, unrelenting Xenomorph hunting you, the game emphasizes stealth, resourcefulness, and sheer terror. Unlike action-oriented Alien games, Isolation focuses on vulnerability - you cannot kill the Alien, only avoid it using the environment, crafting items, and quick thinking. The game features authentic retro-futuristic technology, dynamic AI that learns your behavior, and intense atmosphere that perfectly recreates the tension of the original film. With its nerve-wracking gameplay and faithful Alien universe setting, Alien: Isolation stands as one of the most authentic horror experiences in gaming.",

Unlike traditional horror games, Among the Sleep creates terror through atmosphere and the child's limited perception rather than combat. Crawl through eerie environments, solve simple puzzles, and hide from threatening entities while trying to understand what's happening. With its unique perspective, emotional depth, and genuinely unsettling atmosphere, Among the Sleep offers a horror experience unlike any other that will stay with you long after playing.",

You play as Isaac Clarke, an engineer sent to repair the USG Ishimura, a massive mining starship that has gone silent. Upon arrival, you discover the ship has become a floating graveyard, its crew mutilated and reanimated as horrific alien creatures called Necromorphs. With no traditional HUD, all information is displayed on Isaac's suit and weapons. The game emphasizes strategic combat - simply shooting enemies won't stop them; you must systematically dismember their limbs. Featuring zero-gravity environments, chilling audio design, and a deeply immersive atmosphere, Dead Space delivers relentless tension and horror as you uncover the dark secrets of the Ishimura and the mysterious Marker artifact.",

Set in a long-abandoned Freddy Fazbear's Mega Pizzaplex, you play as a night security guard who discovers the facility's darkest secret: experimental Mimic animatronics designed to replicate human movement and speech. These advanced machines learn from your actions, making each playthrough uniquely terrifying. The game features both classic security camera monitoring and new VR-style first-person exploration sequences. With advanced AI that adapts to your playstyle, randomized jump scare patterns, and a deep lore that connects to the broader FNAF universe, Secret of the Mimic delivers the most psychologically intense FNAF experience yet. The game also introduces a new 'Mimic Detection' system where players must identify imposters among normal animatronics by spotting subtle behavioral tells.",

As a maintenance worker trapped during the night shift, you must navigate pitch-black corridors while being hunted by inhuman creatures. The game emphasizes psychological horror and tense survival mechanics - conserve your limited flashlight batteries, solve environmental puzzles, and hide when confrontation isn't an option. Featuring a dynamic AI that learns from your behavior, no two playthroughs are exactly alike. The industrial environment becomes a character itself, with malfunctioning machinery and shifting layouts that keep you constantly disoriented. With its oppressive atmosphere, unpredictable threats, and emphasis on player vulnerability, White Knuckle delivers an uncompromising horror experience that will leave you gripping your controller until your knuckles turn white.",

The game blends base-building, resource management, and social deduction as you recruit allies, set traps, and engage in absurd suburban combat. The multiplayer mode supports 2-8 players in team-based matches where deception is key - pretend to be a friendly neighbor while secretly sabotaging block parties or poisoning hedges. With destructible environments, customizable homes, and escalating prank wars, every match becomes a unique story of suburban chaos. The single-player campaign features a story mode where you uncover neighborhood conspiracies through increasingly outrageous missions.",
